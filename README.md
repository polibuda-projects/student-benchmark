 <br/>

 ### Requirements:
 - [Spring](https://spring.io)

 ## 1. Committing changes

 ### Make sure you are on `backend-experiments` branch
 ```bash
 git branch
 git checkout backend-experiments
 ```

 ### Pulling from the repository
 ```bash
 git pull
 ```

 ### Adding files
 ```bash
 git add <file>
 ```

 ### Checking status of files
 ```bash
 git status
 ```

 ### Committing files
 ```bash
 git commit -m "<commit message>"
 ```

 ### Pushing to the repository
 ```bash
 git push origin
 ```

 ## 2. Commit naming conventions
 - Backend commits should start with `b` (e.g. `b added registration`)
 - Commits should be written in past tense (e.g. `b added registration` instead of `b add registration`)
 - If applicable, commit message should include name of the Trello card (e.g. `b added registration <trello card name>`)

 ## Important notes

 - ### Pull changes before pushing
 - ### Do not commit to the `main` branch
 - ### Make sure that you are on `backend-experiments` branch
